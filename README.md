# mobar-manipulator
This is a deployment of the Model-Based Architecture (MoBAr) for a 5 DoF homemade robotic arm (using servomotors for the joints and grip). Most of the implementation is done by Alejandro Mora Prieto for his degree dissertation under the supervision of María Dolores Rodríguez Moreno and Pablo Muñoz Martínez.

The code will not be updated but can be used. As well, the instructions for build and execute the system will not be used, but you can easily figure out how to deal with it by looking at the main makefile. A video of the system working can be seen in YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEVBsY89R-U
